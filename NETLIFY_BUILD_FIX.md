# Netlify Build Error Fix

## Problem

The build process on Netlify was failing with the error:

```
Error: Call retries were exceeded
```

This error typically occurs due to network issues or temporary problems reaching external resources during the build process.

## Solution Implemented

The following changes have been made to address the network-related build issues:

### 1. Package.json Updates

- Modified the build script to use `npm ci --prefer-offline --no-audit` which helps with network reliability
- Added the `--emptyOutDir` flag to Vite build for cleaner builds

### 2. Netlify Configuration

- Added environment variables in netlify.toml to optimize network requests
- Created a custom retry plugin with proper manifest.yml to handle network errors gracefully
- Added build processing configuration to improve build stability

### 3. NPM Configuration

- Added .npmrc file with network timeout and retry settings
- Configured cache settings to reduce network requests

### 4. Vite Configuration

- Added asset inline limit and chunk size warning limit settings
- Configured esbuildOptions with optimized settings for network reliability
- Improved build performance settings

## How to Test

After deploying these changes to your repository:

1. Trigger a new build on Netlify
2. Monitor the build logs for any network-related errors
3. If the build completes successfully, the changes have resolved the issue

## Additional Recommendations

If you continue to experience build failures:

1. Consider using Netlify's cache plugin to improve build performance
2. Check if any dependencies have known network issues and consider pinning specific versions
3. Monitor your Netlify build logs for any other potential issues
